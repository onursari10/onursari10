👋 Hi, I’m Onur Sarı

👀 I’m a **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** with a solid background in Financial Operations and ERP Systems. I specialize in identifying complex logic errors, functional testing, and ensuring data integrity.
🌱 I’m currently advancing my skills in **API Testing (Postman), Test Automation (Playwright), and Advanced SQL**.
💞️ My core strength is bridging the gap between business logic and software quality. (I also have a technical background in indie game development, which gives me a strong "white-box" perspective on how code structure works and where bugs hide!)
📫 You can reach me professionally on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/onursari10) or via email at onursari10@hotmail.com.
